Business logic notes for the Amalgamator:
  • User Accounts:
    • Education level, age, location, one link to SM mandate, rest is optional
  • Post Frequency
    • Only one Amalgamation can be exposed/produced to a user in any hours time 
  • AmaCredits 
    • 10 Amalgamations create 1 contribution point (post removal and/or abandonment of topic will decease contribution points respectively.)
    • One contribution point opens one of two things:
      • the ability to bypass the hour amalgamation creation requirement
      • the ability to jump to a specific amalgamation id (yes, people will need to know it (foreseeably through internet resources outside the app) and refer to a specific identifier based on adv algorithm).
  • Visibility
    • Once a user creates or contributes to an Amalgamation 
  • Counts 
    • Global count of amalgamations made/left, pioneer achievements and veteran achievements include invites to new systems. 
  • Notifications 
    • Any time a user encounters an amalgamation (anon) or contributes/revisits an amalgamation that you are a current contributor on (you have not left) an alert containing a truncated portion of the contributions
  • Modes of Use 
    • Focused
    • Open 
    • Revisit and edit
